									<h2>Teaching</h2>
									<p>I've had the privilege to teach several courses at both Tufts and Stanford University! As an undergraduate, I was a TA for the honors introductory Mechanics labs,  
                    leading office hours, performing derviations, and managing the lab curriculum. As a graduate student, I spent my first year TA-ing for the introductory Mechanics
                    and Electricity and Magnetism labs. I led classrooms of up to 14 students through each individual lab, holding discussion sessions and workign through derivations
                    as well!

									<h2>Conferences</h2>
									<p>
                     I was an invited participant at the CHOIR: New Data that Challenge Underling Assumptions in Early Galaxy Evolution conference. In that capacity, I participated in several breakout-style teaching sessions on high-z AGN, 
                    compact and red galaxies, dust in galaxies, inclusive pedagogy, and astronomy and indigeneity.
                  While at the conference I also wrote an astrobites summary on the high-z AGN session and was a contributing writer to the white paper `"Dust ABCs for the Dust Curious."

									<h2>Outreach</h2>
									<p>
                    Most recently, as part of outreach for the Tufts Physics and Astronomy Department, I gave a volunteer outreach presentation to an Astronomy class of primarily high school seniors, where we 
                    discussed star formation, binary orbits, and observing extrasolar systems. 
									</p>
                	<p>
                    When I was in undergrad, I volunteered as a SPINWIP (Stanford Program for Inspiring the Next Generation of Women in Physics) counselor for two summers.
                    The program was 3-week-long virtual summer outreach program hosted by the Stanford Physics Department and the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, designed to get high-school girls excited about physics.
                    In my work as a counselor/instructor, I led coding sessions, discussions on cutting-edge research, and advised them on their physics-based projects!
