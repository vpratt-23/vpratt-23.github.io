									<h2>Little Red Dots</h2>
									<h3>Advisor: Danilo Marchesini (Tufts University)</h3>
									<p>I've analyzed JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data as well as PRISM spectroscopy to develop color 
									classifications of Little Red Dot (LRD) galaxies and create composite spectral energy distribution templates. In this work, I modeled spectral energy distributions with Bayesian
									python packages. I subsequently have begun searching for LRDs in HSC data, looking across redshifts to better understand
									how they evolve with cosmic time. In this research I am also completing a principal component analysis to determine which
									telescope filters are most curcial to detecting LRDs.

									<h2>Sympathetic Flares</h2>
									<h3>Advisor: David Martin (Tufts University)</h3>
									<p>
										In this project, I worked with TESS data to find flaring M-Dwarfs and, specifically, to hunt for 
										sympathetic flares on non-solar stars. I developed a theoretical Monte Carlo simulation to understand
										the mechanisms behind stellar flares and sympathetic flare rates. Subsequently, I applied statistical anlyses, 
										focusing on Poisson vs. Weibull distributions alongside bootstrappign techniques, to the real TESS data. 
										In this project, I uncovered the most conclusive evidence to date pointing towards the existence on sympathetic
										flares on other stars! A paper is being written, to be submittted by Sept. 2025.

									<h2>Dwarf Galaxies in the SAGA Survey</h2>
									<h3>Advisor: Risa Wechsler (Stanford University)</h3>
									<p>
										During my undergraduate years, I worked with Professor Risa Wechsler to analyze the SAGA survey data to better understnad
										the formation of large satellite gaalxies as it related to galactic clustering. I contributed to large improvements
										to neural-network galaxy simulations based on my findings that the simualtions consistently underpredicted the amount of
										large satellites. In Professor Wechsler's group, I also mentored junior undergrates and contributed to their summer projects.
